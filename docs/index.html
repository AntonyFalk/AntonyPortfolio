        <p>Here is an example of a <a href="about.html">relative link</a> to a page inside the same folder.</p>
        <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some
                <strong>inline</strong> code to feature some text. Here is <a
                    href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>. It is awesome.</p>
        <p>One of the best resources for learning HTML is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. 
            Here is a reference for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. Here's some positions you can find a cat in</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sitting</li>
            <li>loafing</li>
            <li>curled in a ball</li>
            <li>lying on back showing belly</li>
            <li>lying stretched out</li>
        </ul>

        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list.
